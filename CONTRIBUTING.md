# Contributing to Plenty Network

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

# Project setup

Before running anything, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running the interface locally

```
npm run dev
```

The interface should automatically open. If it does not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000].

## Creating a production build

```
npm run build
```

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request to `development`!
7. Make sure the PR has a description (It's important to provide as much useful information and a rationale for why you're making this pull request in the first place.)

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License
